Guide & Rule Book! <img src="/images/gameResources/other/maj.png" title="The Majeggstics" class="icon" />

Welcome to The Majeggstics, where _No Farmer is Left Behind_!

Majeggstics is a worldwide group of Egg Inc. players with the common goal of making sure
_every_ player can complete _every_ contract, by optimizing play strategies and making
fair contributions to our co-ops.

<span id="coop_types"></span>
## Co-op Types

Majeggstics offers multiple different kinds of co-ops to cater to many different
playstyles in the community.

<div class="infobox">
**Best Fit** <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/contract_grade_any.png" title="Best Fit Anygrade" class="icon" />:
The standard co-op experience in Majeggstics. All contracts are run as <mark>AAA
Anygrades</mark> <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/contract_grade_any.png"
title="Anygrade" class="icon" /> to get everyone the best rewards despite their personal
contract grade. All co-ops are pre-created by volunteers in the group, so you don't have
to worry about creating your own. <mark>Best Fit</mark> refers to the way people are
grouped together. If you have a fast playstyle (farming tokens, boosting quickly, maxing
habs, high deflector uptime, etc.) you will also be grouped with people that prefer to
play this way. But there's no shame in playing slower and more idle! After all, it's an
idle game.

**Fast Runs** <img src="/images/gameResources/other/racecar.png" title="Fast Runs" class="icon" />:
Majeggstics also has co-ops for those that want to be even faster. <mark>Fast
runs</mark> are an inbetween ground from <mark>Best Fit</mark> and <mark>Speed
Runs</mark>. To join Fastlane and get access to <mark>Fast Runs</mark> you need
specific requirements, which target more advanced players. In a <mark>Fast Run</mark>
you are expected to join faster, fill habs quicker and have a specific contribution or
higher, just to name a few rules.

**Speed Runs** <img src="/images/gameResources/other/rocket.png" title="Speed Runs" class="icon" />:
The fastest of the fast. These co-ops expect high commitment to token farming, boosting
as soon as possible, optimizing artifacts and stones in every co-op, have very tight
rules for how co-ops are run, and teach you how to land on the leaderboards.
</div>

For the contents of this guide we are focusing on the <mark>Best Fit</mark> co-ops,
which are the general Majeggstics experience. Information about <mark>Fastlane</mark> is
readily available in your <mark>[Welcome Thread][welcome-thread]</mark> and in
<mark>[\#the_majeggstics][the_majeggstics]</mark>.

<span id="contract_rules"></span>
## Contract Rules

The Majeggstics are a team&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we expect everyone to contribute to our
co-ops to the best of their ability. When you register for a contract, you are agreeing
to join your co-op and to meet the minimum contribution for that contract.

**The minimum egg laying rate for each contract is linked in
<mark>[\#mj-announcements][mj-announcements]</mark>. You can also run the `/getminimums`
command for the contract and the Majeggstics group. Minimums are measured at 12 and 24
hours after contract start.**

We are handing out strikes to members that do not comply with the rules set for our
group. These strikeable offenses are the following:

<div class="infobox">
	**Failed to reach minimums after 24 hours**:
	The 12 hour minimum is lower than the 24 hour minimum and you have to meet either at the
	respective time to pass. If you met the 12 hour minimum you don't have to meet the 24
	hour minimum anymore. If you **fail to meet both 12 hour and 24 hour minimum**, you will
	receive a strike.

	**Failed to join the co-op on time**:
	You will receive a strike for joining your co-op later than **5 hours after start**, and
	an additional strike if you have not joined by the 24 hour check.

	**More than 30 hours of consecutive offline time**:
	You will receive a strike if you are not logging into the game for **over 30 hours**.
	Time after the contract entered yellow scroll does not count.
</div>

<div class="advicebox">
	_Tokens_ <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" />
	are the human players who manage the Majeggstics&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we recruit new
	members, help people play the game more efficiently, start and add people to co-op
	groups, and confirm everyone has met the minimum required laying rate for each
	contract. You can see someone is a Token by the little token icon <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" />
	next to their name.
</div>

<span id="strike_communication"></span>
## Strike Communication

A Token <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" />
will create or message you in a private thread in <mark>[\#the_majeggstics][the_majeggstics]</mark>
to talk about what happened and offer help on how to prevent this from happening in the
future. Strikes are recorded and after getting four strikes, you will be removed from
Majeggstics. Strikes are only counted for the last 20 contracts, whether you played them
or not&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;after that, strikes are erased.

<div class="advicebox">
	If you're concerned during your co-op that you won't be able to meet minimums, you can
	send `mj-support` anywhere in Majeggstics channels (preferably in your co-op thread)
	and a support Token <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" />
	will help you out. It can take some time to respond, so ask for help early on!
</div>

Remember that the Majeggstic's goal is to see everyone succeed. Minimums are meant to
help you, not hurt. If you're struggling to meet minimum or need help with a contract,
ask for advice in <mark>[\#the_majeggstics][the_majeggstics]</mark> or
<mark>[\#mj-help][mj-help]</mark> channels. The group would be thrilled to help, and
everyone will have the chance to learn along with you!

<span id="registering_for_a_contract"></span>
## Registering for a Contract

**Contracts are released 3 times a week at:**

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Your Local Time</th>
			<th class="time">
				<LocalContractDrop />
			</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>

			<td class="time">02:00 (2:00 am)</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Contract release times are affected by Daylight Savings Time in the US and may change
throughout the year.

<div class="infobox">
	**Monday** has a new contract for everyone.

	**Wednesday** has a non-PE leggacy contract which usually rewards boosts, GE or artifact boxes.

	**Friday** has a PE <img src="/images/gameResources/other/Egg_of_Prophecy.png" title="Egg of Prophecy" class="icon" /> leggacy contract.

	<span class="note">
		(If you have an ULTRA <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/Ultra_Subscription.png" title="Ultra Subscription" class="icon" />
		Standard or ULTRA <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/Ultra_Subscription.png" title="Ultra Subscription" class="icon" />
		Pro subscription, you will get an additional leggacy PE contract on Fridays)
	</span>

	If you want to be pinged when contracts are released, go to

	<mark>[\#optional-roles](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/877532667338432533)</mark> and
	select the “Contracts” role.
</div>

On the day of a contract release, a registration post will be posted in

<mark>[\#mj-announcements][mj-announcements]</mark> a few hours before contract drop time (for the
ULTRA <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/Ultra_Subscription.png" title="Ultra Subscription" class="icon" />
only contract on Friday the registration post will be in <mark>[\#mj-ultra][mj-ultra]</mark>).
Select a time slot&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we start contracts at +1 <img src="/images/gameResources/other/react_rare.png" title="Timeslot 1" class="icon" />,
+6 <img src="/images/gameResources/other/react_legendary.png" title="Timeslot 2" class="icon" />,
and +12 <img src="/images/gameResources/other/react_epic.png" title="Timeslot 3" class="icon" /> hours
after the contract release. Register for the time slot that's most convenient for your schedule. You
must join your co-op and start your farm within 5 hours of your start time. It is your
responsibility to register early and join your co-op.

Registration for each time slot is closed when Wonky creates co-ops. We recommend you
sign up at least 15 minutes early, as co-ops may be created up to 5 minutes early
because of the size of our group. If co-ops are late, be patient with initiators. Wonky
is subject to heavy rate limiting from discord, especially noticeable on small co-op
sizes. Please patiently wait until co-ops are created!

Late registrations may be accepted in <mark>[\#mj-contracts][mj-contracts]</mark>
depending on initiator availability and available spaces in our co-ops. If you request a
spot in a different channel our intitators will not be able to reply to you and get you
an available spot. If you are unable to register for a contract with Majeggstics, you
can ask for a rerun in <mark>[\#mj-freestyle][mj-freestyle]</mark> once the co-ops for
Majeggstics have finished, join a public co-op in the **Co-Op Recruitment** section or
organise your own contract with others!

<div class="alertbox">
	Even if you join as a requested late join as mentioned above, you will still be expected to meet
	the minimum for the closest time slot. Check the message that pinged you in the co-op thread to
	know, which minimum you will be expected to meet!
</div>

<span id="joining_your_coop"></span>
## Joining your co-op

Wonky generates your co-op and starts a thread in

<mark>[\#mj-contracts][mj-contracts]</mark>. Check your DMs from Wonky or the ping in
said thread for the contract code.

<div class="infobox">
All our co-ops are precreated as <mark>Anygrade AAA</mark> <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/contract_grade_any.png" title="Anygrade" class="icon" />
co-ops, done by members of the group who have an active ULTRA <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/Ultra_Subscription.png" title="Ultra Subscription" class="icon" />
subscription and volunteer to help us. You will *not* have to start the co-op yourself.

Our co-ops are set to **private** to ensure that everyone participating meets our
expectations. Do **not share your co-op code or set the co-op to
public**&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;this can result in Majeggstics members getting kicked
from our co-ops and causes extra work for Tokens <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" />.

If there is a **problem with your registration or co-op** (e.g. registered in multiple
co-ops, unable to join co-op due to grade) make use of the `!mj-coop` command in your
co-op thread. Tokens <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token"
class="icon" /> will be with you shortly to resolve the issue.

<div class="alertbox">
	There is currently a known bug when joining co-ops&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you appear joined on your
	device, but not on the Egg Inc servers. Please confirm your game is in sync with the server by
	checking the eicoop link in your co-op thread *before boosting*.
</div>

Wonky groups members together to ensure we have balanced teams. You **must join the
co-op you are assigned to**.

1. If you join your co-op **later than 5 hours** after start, you will receive **one
   strike**.
2. If you join your co-op **before the 24-hour check**, you will receive **two strikes**.
3. If you join a Majeggstics co-op without being assigned by Wonky or a Token <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" /> or share the co-op code outside of Majeggstics, _you might be removed from Majeggstics_.

Tokens <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon"
/> monitor many co-op threads and can't respond to every message. If you need help, make
sure to ask in <mark>[\#mj-contracts][mj-contracts]</mark> or use the `!mj-coop` command
for problems with the co-op itself or the `mj-support` command for gameplay and minimum
related issues. Don't be afraid to interrupt off-topic chat&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;our priority is helping your co-op complete successfully.

</div>

<span id="start_your_farm"></span>
## Start and grow your contract farm

1. Finish common research, buy habs and buy transport.

   - Use artifacts that increase income like <mark>Demeter's Necklace</mark>,
     <mark>Tungsten Ankh</mark>, <mark>Vial of Martian Dust</mark>, <mark>Book of Basan</mark> and
     artifacts that hold <mark>Shell Stones</mark>, <mark>Terra Stones</mark>, <mark>
     	Soul Stones
     </mark> and <mark>Prophecy Stones</mark>.
   - <mark>Puzzle Cubes</mark> will lower research costs&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;use your
     income-boosting artifacts, then switch your <mark>Puzzle Cube</mark> on while you're buying. If
     you need to save more, swap it out for a better income artifact.

2. Once you are done building your farm up as much as you can, equip your best

   <mark>Ship in a Bottle</mark> ("SIAB") and <mark>Tachyon Deflector</mark> (prioritize
   <mark>Tachyon Deflector</mark> if you only have room for one) to help your team out and to make
   it easier for early boosting players to optimize their stones and artifacts right away.

3. Use a <mark>Soul Mirror</mark> if you can't finish your common research or buy large enough habs/transport for your intended boosts. This will mirror the highest EB in your co-op and makes it easier to finish Common Research.
   - The person in your contract with the highest EB will have a soul mirror icon <img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Soul_Mirror.png" title="Soul Mirror" class="icon" /> next to their name in your Discord thread. You may ask them kindly to equip their EB set, but remember that they are also just players in this co-op and have no obligation to reply to you or to do as you ask. Most of them will be happy to help you out though.
   - If you are struggling despite the <img
     src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Soul_Mirror.png" title="Soul Mirror"
     class="icon" /> <mark>Soul Mirror</mark>, you can use <img
     src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Jimbos_Excellent_Bird_Feed_short.png"
     title="3x Jimbos Birdfeed" class="icon" /><img
     src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Jimbos_Premium_Bird_Feed_short.png"
     title="10x Jimbos Birdfeed" class="icon" /><img
     src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Jimbos_Best_Bird_Feed_short.png"
     title="50x Jimbos Birdfeed" class="icon" /> <mark>Bird Feeds</mark> in combination to increase your earnings even more.

<div class="advicebox">
	While using a <mark>Soul Mirror</mark>, EB increasing artifacts on yourself have no effect.{' '}
	<mark>Book of Basan</mark>,<mark>Soul Stones</mark> and <mark>Prophecy Stones</mark> will not
	increase the earnings in this case, rather swap for
	<mark>Shell Stones</mark> or <mark>Terra Stones</mark> and a different earning artifact like a{' '}
	<mark>Vial of Martian Dust</mark>.
</div>

4. Send <mark>Chicken Runs</mark> every 3 hours to help your co-op mates grow their farms.

5. Request or send _tokens_ <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" /> to other co-op members upon request.
   - Sending tokens to another player can lower their contract teamwork
     score&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;be thoughtful when sending tokens, and do not spam send individual tokens. Consider if your teammate has already boosted and how many tokens an AFK player will return to before you send tokens.
   - Spamming individual tokens or token dumping is not allowed.

<span id="boosting"></span>
## Boosting

Use the [Gompaniyon ↗][gompaniyon] and the [Majeggstics Contract Boost Calculator ↗][contractboostcalc] to help determine the best boost combination for your goals. These will vary widely depending on the contract, number of players in your group, your EB and artifacts.

The general Boost strategy we recommend is <img
src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Soul_Mirror.png" title="Soul Mirror"
class="icon" /> <mark>Soul Mirror</mark> (focusing on IHR research), then <img
src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Large_Tachyon_Prism.png" title="10x 4h Large
Tachyon" class="icon" /><img
src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Epic_Tachyon_Prism.png" title="100x 2h Epic
Tachyon" class="icon" /><img
src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Legendary_Tachyon_Prism.png" title="1000x 10min
Legendary Tachyon" class="icon" /> <mark>Tachyon Boosts</mark>, then <img
src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Soul_Mirror.png" title="Soul Mirror"
class="icon" /> <mark>Soul Mirror</mark> (focusing on shipping and lay rate research).

<div class="advicebox">
	Do not underestimate <mark>Epic Research</mark> in your boosting. Make sure to follow the *Epic
	Research Buying Order* (CIRIA GIMME THE LINK) and once you have at least one level of
	<mark>Internal Hatchery Calm</mark> go offline while your <mark>Tachyons</mark> are running!
</div>

<div class="infobox">
Recommended Boost Strategies by farmer rank (these are only guidelines, please check yourself what will get you to the minimums and ask `mj-support` for help if you need it!):

**Farmer / Kilo**:
Using a <img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Soul_Mirror.png" title="Soul
Mirror" class="icon" /> <mark>Soul Mirror</mark> is all we ask. You don't have minimums yet but it's a good habit to get into and shows you want to help your co-op out!

**Mega / Giga**:
This is the time to start using up to five <img
src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Large_Tachyon_Prism.png" title="10x 4h Large
Tachyon" class="icon" /> <mark>Large Tachyon Prisms</mark> (500 GE per) for your
minimums. Remember to <img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Soul_Mirror.png"
title="Soul Mirror" class="icon" /> <mark>Soul Mirror</mark> before and after your Tachyons. It's a good and cheap boosting pattern, however it will be outmatched very quickly.

**Tera / Peta / Exa**:
Now we have to transition to <img
src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Epic_Tachyon_Prism.png" title="100x 2h Epic
Tachyon" class="icon" /> <mark>Epic Tachyons</mark> (4.000 GE per). <mark>Soul
Mirror</mark>, then <img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Epic_Tachyon_Prism.png"
title="100x 2h Epic Tachyon" class="icon" /> 2x <mark>Epic Tachyons</mark> then <img
src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Soul_Mirror.png" title="Soul Mirror"
class="icon" /> <mark>Soul Mirror</mark> should get you there. Once you reach Peta or
Exa and your artifacts are starting to get better, you might be able to skip the second

<img
	src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Soul_Mirror.png"
	title="Soul Mirror"
	class="icon"
/> <mark>Soul Mirror</mark>.

</div>

Other boost combinations:
- Standard boost combination to max habs quickly: <img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Legendary_Tachyon_Prism.png" title="1000x 10min Legendary Tachyon" class="icon" /> <mark>Legendary Tachyon Prism</mark> + <img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Epic_Boost_Beacon.png" title="10x Epic Boost Beacon" class="icon" /> <mark>Epic Boost Beacon</mark> (16.400 GE total)
- Slower / cheaper version for max habs: <img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Legendary_Tachyon_Prism.png" title="1000x 10min Legendary Tachyon" class="icon" /> <mark>Legendary Tachyon Prism</mark> + 2x <img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Boost_Beacon.png" title="2x Boost Beacon" class="icon" /> <mark>Boost Beacon</mark> (11.600 GE total)
- Requires good artifacts and dili set and maxed Epic Research to max: <img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Supreme_Tachyon_Prism.png" title="1000x 1h Supreme Tachyon" class="icon" /> <mark>Supreme Tachyon Prism</mark> (20.000 GE total)
- Old but Gold even for high end players: 2x <img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Epic_Tachyon_Prism.png" title="100x 2h Epic Tachyon" class="icon" /> <mark>Epic Tachyon Prism</mark> (8.000 GE total)

Before boosting, you can extend the duration of boosts if you equip artifacts with

<mark>Dilithium Stones</mark> in them. Immediately after starting your boosts, switch to your best
<mark>Dilithium Monocle</mark>, <mark>Chalice</mark> and artifacts with
<mark>Life Stones</mark> to increase the strength of your <mark>Tachyon Boosts</mark>. Leave the
farm to take advantage of the <mark>Internal Hatchery Calm</mark> Epic Research. If needed, equip a
<mark>Gusset</mark> to increase hab space.

Consider the number of people in your contract and the impact <mark>Tachyon Deflectors</mark> will have on your laying rate&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;choose more GE efficient boosts in larger co-ops.

<span id="postboosting"></span>
## Post-Boosting

<mark>Tachyon Deflectors</mark> boost your co-op mates' laying rates&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;since
Majeggstics aim for equal contributions, a <mark>Tachyon Deflector</mark> will benefit your co-op
overall more than any artifact that only works on your individual farm.

<mark>Quantum Metronome</mark> and artifacts with <mark>Tachyon Stones</mark> boost egg laying rate.

<mark>Interstellar Compass</mark> and artifacts with <mark>Quantum Stones</mark> increase shipping
rate.

<div class="advicebox">
	**Check in regularly and don't let your chickens fall asleep!** The game does not update
	automatically. You must open your co-op farm and sync with the server for us to see your earnings
	before minimums are checked. Please check-in 15 minutes before your minimum check and confirm your
	lay rate using the eicoop link in your thread to avoid getting a strike. If you experience issues
	with syncing the game, please contact `mj-support` for help.
</div>

<div class="alertbox">
**Contact a Token <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" />**:
If you see **glitching** in your group. **Glitching** is not allowed in Majeggstics co-ops.

**Enforcing minimums is the responsibility of Tokens <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" />**:
**Do not ping** low performing members yourself, allow Tokens <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" /> to contact them and offer support.

**Removing members from our contracts is not allowed**:
If you remove Majeggstics players from our co-op without specific instructions from a Token <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" />, _you will be removed from Majeggstics_.

</div>

<span id="completion"></span>
## Completion

After all the boosting has taken place, it's only a matter of waiting, frequently
checking in, and sending chicken runs to your co-op mates until the co-op has finished. Check in ASAP after the contract has finished so that your contract score can be calculated.

<span id="taking_breaks"></span>
## Taking Breaks & Leaving

We're here to help you be successful with contracts, but we understand that you need a break sometimes.

<div class="infobox">
**Not registering**:
You can skip registering for contracts with us whenever you like with no penalties.

**Leaving the group**:
If you're not enjoying being a Majeggstic, want to join another Wonky group, or are retiring from the game, ping one of the leaders of Majeggstics and ask to be removed from the group or remove yourself with the command `/farewell user:[your name]`.

**Staying to socialize**:
If you quit playing but enjoy the community, you can stay in the group. You don't have to play Egg, Inc and we enjoy having friends!

</div>

<span id="code_of_conduct"></span>
## Code of Conduct

It is a privilege for Majeggstics to have access to private channels and Wonky in the
Egg, Inc. server. Because of our special status, we have high expectations for your
behavior in our channels and around the server.

<div class="alertbox">
	If you do not follow the group rules or show unacceptable behavior in the Majeggstics channels,
	you may receive a warning from our Tokens{' '}
	<img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" />. These
	warnings are to be taken seriously&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;if you continue with the behavior you

2. Keep chat in Majeggstics kind and appropriate for all, and be a good representative of Majeggstics in public channels. However, do not advertise the group in public channels.
3. Respect Majeggstics Tokens <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" /> when asked to change your behavior.
4. Current events and politics can only be discussed in <mark>[Off-Topic >
   \#current-events](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/690643609917063268)</mark>.
5. Majeggstics is a friendly and caring group of people, but we are limited in the support we can provide. If you need to chat about mental health, check out:
   - [7 Cups of Tea ↗][7cups]: Free 24/7 chat by trained volunteers.
   - [Dialectical Behaviour Therapy ↗][dialectical]: Free, anonymous, independent skills and tools to help manage big feelings.
   - [Project Lets ↗][projectlets]: Community-support based mental health care, by and for folks with lived experience of mental illness/madness, disability, trauma and neurodivergence.
6. Majeggstics has a system for recruiting that respects server rules and makes sure new members are a good fit for our group and playstyles.
   - Respect server rules about recruitment and co-op chat.
   - Check the pins in <mark>Co-op Recruitment > \#?-grade-coops</mark> to make sure we are currently recruiting, and have friends follow the instructions in our pinned post.
   - People struggling with public co-ops may not be a good fit for Majeggstics. Let
     them know about <mark>Co-op Recruitment</mark> channels and the pinned posts, and allow them to choose the group that's right for them.
7. Keep chat about Majeggstics and Wonky in our channels&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;in public channels this often becomes recruitment or bragging, and reflects poorly on our group.
8. There are many private co-op groups in the server, with different playstyles and requirements for joining. Be respectful of the other groups and how they play the game, even if it's different from us.
9. You will be removed from Majeggstics for glitching/cheating in our co-ops.
   - Server staff are notified of cheating players and may apply server-wide penalties.
10. Use bot command channels instead of discussion channels to send commands:
    - <mark>
      	[Utilities >
      	\#bot-commands](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/455512567004004353)
      </mark>
    - <mark>
      	[Wonky >
      	\#public-wonky-commands](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/850486132713455616)
      </mark>
    - <mark>

      	wonky-spam](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/1082528529754898482)
      </mark>
11. Don't try to break bots, and be patient when bots are down.
12. Keep spam in <mark>[Off Topic > \#spam](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/455388192674283521)</mark>.
13. Direct Messages (DM)
    - Majeggstics is privileged to have threads for all of our
      co-ops&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;ping members in your thread instead of sending a DM or sending tokens <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" /> in-game.
    - Use Majeggstics and server channels to ask general questions instead of sending DMs to other players, Tokens <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" />, or server staff.
    - If you see inappropriate chat in Majeggstics channels, or glitching in our co-ops, you can react with the `:flag_white:` emoji to notify Majeggstics Tokens <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" />. Wonky will automatically remove your reaction to protect your privacy, and Tokens <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" /> will get a copy of the message.
    - Follow instructions in <mark>[Utilities >
      \#ticket-tool](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/968650654694379560)</mark> for help from server staff (unwanted/inappropriate DMs, glitching in non-Majeggstic co-ops, etc).
    - If you get removed from the group, you will receive a DM from a Token <img src="/images/gameResources/contract/B_token.png" title="Token" class="icon" /> of Majeggstics. This will usually state the reason why you got removed as well as any further process that may offer re-entry into the group.
