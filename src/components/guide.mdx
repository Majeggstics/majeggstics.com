<h1 id="welcome"><Icons.Maj /> Majeggstics Guide & Rule Book! <Icons.Maj /></h1>

Welcome to The Majeggstics, where _No Farmer is Left Behind_!

Majeggstics is a worldwide group of Egg Inc. players with the common goal of making sure
_every_ player can complete _every_ contract, by optimizing play strategies and making
fair contributions to our co-ops.

<Anchored h2="Co-op Types" />

Majeggstics offers multiple different kinds of co-ops to cater to many different
playstyles in the community.

<div class="infobox">
**Best Fit** <Icons.Anygrade />: The standard co-op experience in Majeggstics. All
contracts are run as <mark>AAA Anygrades</mark> <Icons.Anygrade /> to get everyone the
best rewards regardless of their personal contract grade. All co-ops are pre-created by
volunteers, so you don't have to worry about creating your own. <mark>Best Fit</mark>
refers to the way people are grouped together. If you have a fast playstyle (farming
tokens, boosting quickly, maxing habs, high deflector uptime, etc.) you will also be
grouped with people that prefer to play this way. But there's no shame in playing slower
and more idle! After all, it's an idle game.

**Fast Runs** <Icons.FastRun />:
Majeggstics also has co-ops for those that want to be even faster. To join the
<mark>Fastlane</mark> and get access to <mark>Fast Runs</mark> you need to meet specific
high-tier artifact requirements which target more advanced players. In a <mark>Fast
Run</mark> you are expected to join faster, fill habs quicker and have a specific
contribution or higher, just to name a few rules.

**Speed Runs** <Icons.SpeedRun />:
The fastest of the fast. These co-ops expect high commitment to token farming, boosting
as soon as possible, optimizing artifacts and stones in every co-op, have very tight
rules for how co-ops are run, and teach you how to land on the seasonal leaderboards.
</div>

For the contents of this guide we are focusing on the <mark>Best Fit</mark> co-ops,
which are the general Majeggstics experience. Information about <mark>Fastlane</mark> is
readily available in your <mark>[Welcome Thread][welcome-thread]</mark> and in
<mark>[\#the_majeggstics][the_majeggstics]</mark>.

<Anchored h2="Contract Rules" />

The Majeggstics are a team&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we expect everyone to contribute to our
co-ops to the best of their ability. When you register for a contract, you are agreeing
to join your co-op and to meet the minimum contribution for that contract.

**The minimum egg laying rate for each contract is linked in
<mark>[\#mj-announcements][mj-announcements]</mark>. You can also run the `/getminimums`
command for the contract and the Majeggstics group. Minimums are measured at 12 and 24
hours after contract start.**

We give strikes to members that do not meet our group's specific expectations:

<div class="infobox">
    **Failure to reach minimums after 24 hours**:
    The 12 hour minimum is lower than the 24 hour minimum and you have to meet either at the
    respective time to pass. If you met the 12 hour minimum you don't have to meet the 24
    hour minimum anymore. If you **fail to meet both 12 hour and 24 hour minimum**, you will
    receive a strike.

    **Failure to join the co-op on time**:
    You will receive a strike for joining your co-op later than **5 hours after start**, and
    an additional strike if you have not joined by the 24 hour check.

    **More than 30 hours of consecutive offline time**:
    You will receive a strike if you are not logging into the game for **over 30 hours**.
    Time after the contract entered yellow scroll does not count.
</div>

<div class="advicebox">
    **Tokens** <Icons.Token />
    are the human players who manage the Majeggstics&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we recruit new
    members, help people play the game more efficiently, start and add people to co-op
    groups, and confirm everyone has met the minimum required laying rate for each
    contract. You can see someone is a Token by the little token icon <Icons.Token />
    next to their name.
</div>

<Anchored h2="Strike Communication" />

A Token <Icons.Token />
will create or message you in a private thread in <mark>[\#the_majeggstics][the_majeggstics]</mark>
to talk about what happened and offer help on how to prevent this from happening in the
future. Strikes are recorded and after getting four strikes, you will be removed from
Majeggstics. Strikes are only counted for the last 20 contracts, whether you played them
or not&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;after that, strikes are erased.

<div class="advicebox">
    If you're concerned during your co-op that you won't be able to meet minimums, you can
    send `mj-support` in your co-op thread and a support Token <Icons.Token />
    will help you out. It can take some time to respond, so ask for help early on!
</div>

Remember that the Majeggstic's goal is to see everyone succeed. Minimums are meant to
help everyone reach their goals, not hurt you. If you're struggling to meet minimum or
need help with a contract, ask for advice in
<mark>[\#the_majeggstics][the_majeggstics]</mark> or <mark>[\#mj-help][mj-help]</mark>
channels. The group would be thrilled to help, and everyone will have the chance to
learn along with you!

Contract release times are affected by Daylight Savings Time in the US and may change
throughout the year.

<div class="infobox">
    **Monday** has a new contract for everyone.

    **Wednesday** has a non-PE <mark>leggacy contract</mark> which usually rewards boosts, GE or artifact boxes.

    **Friday** has a PE <Icons.ProphecyEgg /> <mark>leggacy contract</mark>.

        (If you have an <mark>ULTRA <Icons.Ultra />
        STANDARD</mark> or <mark>ULTRA <Icons.Ultra />
        PRO</mark> subscription, you will get an additional leggacy PE contract on Fridays)

    If you want to be pinged when contracts are released, go to <mark>[\#optional-roles](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/877532667338432533)</mark> and
    select the “Contracts” role.
</div>

On the day of a contract release, a registration post will be posted in <mark>[\#mj-announcements][mj-announcements]</mark>
a few hours before contract drop time (for the <mark>ULTRA <Icons.Ultra /></mark>-only contract on Friday, the registration post will be in <mark>[\#mj-ultra][mj-ultra]</mark>).
Select a time slot&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we start contracts at +1 <img src="/images/gameResources/other/react_rare.png" title="Timeslot 1" class="icon" />,
+6 <img src="/images/gameResources/other/react_legendary.png" title="Timeslot 2" class="icon" />,
and +12 <img src="/images/gameResources/other/react_epic.png" title="Timeslot 3" class="icon" /> hours
after the contract release. Register for the time slot that's most convenient for your schedule. You
must join your co-op and start your farm within 5 hours of your start time. It is your
responsibility to register early and join your co-op.

Registration for each time slot is closed when Wonky creates co-ops. We recommend you
sign up at least 15 minutes early, as co-ops may be created up to 5 minutes early
because of the size of our group. If co-ops are late, be patient with initiators. Wonky
is subject to heavy rate limiting from discord, especially noticeable on small co-op
sizes. Please wait patiently until co-ops are created!

Late registrations may be accepted in <mark>[\#mj-contracts][mj-contracts]</mark>
depending on initiator availability and available spaces in our co-ops. If you request a
spot in a different channel our intitators will not be able to reply to you and get you
an available spot. If you are unable to register for a contract with Majeggstics, you
can ask for a rerun in <mark>[\#mj-freestyle][mj-freestyle]</mark> once the co-ops for
Majeggstics have finished, join a public co-op in the **Co-Op Recruitment** section or
organise your own contract with others!

<div class="alertbox">
    Even if you join as a requested late join as mentioned above, you will still be expected to meet
    the minimum for the closest time slot. Check the message that pinged you in the co-op thread to
    know which minimum you will be expected to meet!
</div>

<Anchored h2="Joining your co-op" />

Wonky generates your group and starts a thread in <mark>[\#mj-contracts][mj-contracts]</mark>.
Check your DMs from Wonky or the ping in that thread for the contract code.

<div class="infobox">
All our co-ops are precreated as <mark>Anygrade AAA</mark> <Icons.Anygrade />
co-ops, done by members of the group who have an active <mark>ULTRA <Icons.Ultra /></mark>
subscription and volunteer to help us. You will *not* have to start the co-op yourself.

Our co-ops are set to **private** to ensure that everyone participating meets our
expectations. Do **not share your co-op code or set the co-op to
public**&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;this can result in Majeggstics members getting kicked
from our co-ops and causes extra work for Tokens <Icons.Token />.

If there is a **problem with your registration or co-op** (e.g. registered in multiple
co-ops, unable to join co-op due to grade) make use of the `!mj-coop` command in your
co-op thread. Tokens <Icons.Token /> will be with you shortly to resolve the issue.

<div class="alertbox">
    There is currently a known bug when joining co-ops&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you appear joined on your
    device, but not on the Egg Inc servers. Please confirm your game is in sync with the server by
    checking the `eicoop` link in your co-op thread **before boosting**.
</div>

Wonky groups members together to ensure we have balanced teams. You **must join the
co-op you are assigned to**.

1. If you join your co-op **later than 5 hours** after start, you will receive **one
   strike**.
2. If you join your co-op **later than 24 hours** after start, you will receive **two strikes**.
3. If you join a Majeggstics co-op without being assigned by Wonky or a Token <Icons.Token />
or share the co-op code outside of Majeggstics, _you may be removed from Majeggstics_.

Tokens <Icons.Token />
monitor many co-op threads and can't respond to every message. If you need help, make
sure to ask in <mark>[\#mj-contracts][mj-contracts]</mark>, use the `!mj-coop` command
for problems with the co-op itself, or the `mj-support` command for gameplay and minimum
related issues. Don't be afraid to interrupt off-topic chat&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;our priority is helping your co-op complete successfully.

</div>

<Anchored
  anchor="start_your_farm"
  h2="Start and grow your contract farm"
/>

1. Finish common research, buy habs and buy transport.

   - Use artifacts that increase income like <mark>Demeter's Necklace</mark>,
     <mark>Tungsten Ankh</mark>, <mark>Vial of Martian Dust</mark>, <mark>Book of Basan</mark> and
     artifacts that hold <mark>Shell Stones</mark>, <mark>Terra Stones</mark>,
     <mark>Soul Stones</mark> and <mark>Prophecy Stones</mark>.
   - <mark>Puzzle Cubes</mark> will lower research costs&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;use your
     income-boosting artifacts, then switch your <mark>Puzzle Cube</mark> on while you're buying. If
     you need to save more, swap it out for a better income artifact.

2. Once you are done building your farm up as much as you can, equip your best
   <mark>Ship in a Bottle</mark> ("SIAB") and <mark>Tachyon Deflector</mark> (prioritize
   <mark>Deflector</mark> if you only have room for one) to help your team out.

3. Use a <mark>Soul Mirror</mark> if you can't finish your common research or buy large
   enough habs/transport for your intended boosts. This will temporarily set your
   EB to the highest in your co-op.
   - The person in your contract with the highest EB will have a soul mirror icon
     <Boost.Image boost={Boost.Mirror} />
     next to their name in your Discord thread. Ask them kindly to equip their best EB
     artifacts, but remember that they are just other players, and have no more
     obligation to reply or do as requested than you do, especially if they're busy.
   - If you are struggling despite the <Boost.Image boost={Boost.Mirror} />
     <mark>Soul Mirror</mark>, you can use <img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Jimbos_Excellent_Bird_Feed_short.png" title="3x Jimbos Birdfeed" class="icon" /><img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Jimbos_Premium_Bird_Feed_short.png" title="10x Jimbos Birdfeed" class="icon" /><img src="/images/gameResources/boosts/Boosts_Jimbos_Best_Bird_Feed_short.png" title="50x Jimbos Birdfeed" class="icon" />
     <mark>Bird Feeds</mark> as well to increase your earnings even more.
   - If your mirror is at least a **Zettafarmer**, you **can** max your research and
     habs! You might need to use bird feeds or multiple mirrors, but **no mirror** in
     our group is too small to succeed with, even without their absolute best artifacts.

<div class="advicebox">
    While using a <mark>Soul Mirror</mark>, EB increasing _artifacts_ have no effect.
    Swap your <mark>Book of Basan</mark>, <mark>Soul Stones</mark> and <mark>Prophecy
    Stones</mark> for things like the <mark>Vial of Martian Dust</mark>, <mark>Shell
    Stones</mark>, or <mark>Terra Stones</mark>.
</div>

4. Send <mark>Chicken Runs</mark> every 3 hours to help your co-op mates grow their farms.

5. Request or send _tokens_ <Icons.Token /> to other co-op members upon request.
   - Sending tokens to another player can lower their contract teamwork
     score&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;be thoughtful when sending tokens, and do not spam send individual tokens. Consider if your teammate has already boosted and how many tokens an AFK player will return to before you send tokens.
   - Spamming individual tokens or token dumping is not allowed.

<Anchored h2="Boosting" />

Use the [Gompaniyon ↗][gompaniyon] and the [Majeggstics Contract Boost Calculator ↗][contractboostcalc] to help determine the best boost combination for your goals. These will vary widely depending on the contract, number of players in your group, your EB and artifacts.

The general Boost strategy we recommend is <Boost.Image boost={Boost.Mirror} /> <mark>Soul Mirror</mark>
(focusing on IHR research), then <Boost.Image boost={Boost.LargeTach} /><Boost.Image boost={Boost.EpicTach} /><Boost.Image boost={Boost.LegendaryTach} />
<mark>Tachyon Boosts</mark>, then <Boost.Image boost={Boost.Mirror} />
<mark>Soul Mirror</mark> (focusing on shipping and lay rate research).

<div class="advicebox">
    Do not underestimate <mark>Epic Research</mark> in your boosting. Make sure to follow the <mark>[Epic
    Research Buying Order][epicresearch]</mark> and once you have at least one level of
    <mark>Internal Hatchery Calm</mark> go offline while your <mark>Tachyons</mark> are running!
</div>

<div class="infobox">
Recommended Boost Strategies by farmer rank (these are only guidelines, please check yourself what will get you to the minimums and ask `mj-support` for help if you need it!):

**Farmer / Kilo**:
Using a <Boost.Image boost={Boost.Mirror} /> <mark>Soul Mirror</mark> is all we ask. You don't have minimums yet but it's a good habit to get into and shows you want to help your co-op out!

**Mega / Giga**:
This is the time to start using up to five <Boost.Image boost={Boost.LargeTach} />
<mark>Large Tachyon Prisms</mark> (500 GE per) for your
minimums. Remember to use a <Boost.Image boost={Boost.Mirror} /> <mark>Soul Mirror</mark>
before and after your Tachyons. It's a good and cheap boosting pattern, however it will
be outmatched very quickly.

**Tera / Peta / Exa**:
Now we have to transition to <Boost.Image boost={Boost.EpicTach} /> <mark>Epic Tachyons</mark> (4.000 GE per). <mark>Soul
Mirror</mark>, then <Boost.Image boost={Boost.EpicTach} /> 2x <mark>Epic Tachyons</mark> then
<Boost.Image boost={Boost.Mirror} /> <mark>Soul Mirror</mark> should get you there. Once you reach Peta or
Exa and your artifacts are starting to get better, you might be able to skip the second
<Boost.Image boost={Boost.Mirror} /> <mark>Soul Mirror</mark>.
</div>

Other boost combinations:
- Standard boost combination to max habs quickly: <Boost.Image
  boost={Boost.LegendaryTach} /> <mark>Legendary Tachyon Prism</mark> + <Boost.Image
  boost={Boost.EpicBeacon} /> <mark>Epic Boost Beacon</mark> (16.400 GE total)
- Slower / cheaper version for max habs: <Boost.Image boost={Boost.LegendaryTach} />
  <mark>Legendary Tachyon Prism</mark> + 2x <Boost.Image boost={Boost.Beacon} /> <mark>Boost Beacon</mark> (11.600 GE total)
- Requires good artifacts and dili set and maxed Epic Research to max: <Boost.Image
  boost={Boost.SupremeTach} /> <mark>Supreme Tachyon Prism</mark> (20.000 GE total)
- Old but Gold even for high end players: 2x <Boost.Image boost={Boost.EpicTach} /> <mark>Epic Tachyon Prism</mark> (8.000 GE total)

Before boosting, you can extend the duration of boosts if you equip artifacts with

<mark>Dilithium Stones</mark> in them. Immediately after starting your boosts, switch to your best
<mark>Dilithium Monocle</mark>, <mark>Chalice</mark> and artifacts with
<mark>Life Stones</mark> to increase the strength of your <mark>Tachyon Boosts</mark>. Leave the
farm to take advantage of the <mark>Internal Hatchery Calm</mark> Epic Research. If needed, equip a
<mark>Gusset</mark> to increase hab space.

Consider the number of people in your contract and the impact <mark>Tachyon Deflectors</mark>
will have on your laying rate&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;choose more GE-efficient boosts in larger co-ops.

<Anchored h2="After Boosting" />

<mark>Tachyon Deflectors</mark> boost your co-op mates' laying rates&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;since
Majeggstics aim for equal contributions, a <mark>Tachyon Deflector</mark> will benefit your co-op
overall more than any artifact that only works on your individual farm.

<mark>Quantum Metronome</mark> and artifacts with <mark>Tachyon Stones</mark> boost egg laying rate.

<mark>Interstellar Compass</mark> and artifacts with <mark>Quantum Stones</mark> increase shipping
rate.

<div class="advicebox">
    **Check in regularly and don't let your chickens fall asleep!** The game does not
    update when closed. You must open your co-op farm and sync with the server for your
    earnings to be counted by the game. Please check-in 15 minutes before your minimum
    check and confirm your lay rate using the eicoop link in your thread to avoid
    getting a strike. If you experience issues with syncing the game, please contact
    `mj-support` for help.
</div>

<div class="alertbox">
**Contact a Token <Icons.Token />**:
If you see **glitching** in your group. **Glitching** is not allowed in Majeggstics co-ops.

**Enforcing minimums is the responsibility of Tokens <Icons.Token />**:
**Do not ping** low performing members yourself, allow Tokens <Icons.Token /> to contact them and offer support.

**Removing members from our contracts is not allowed**:
If you remove Majeggstics players from our co-op without specific instructions from a
Token <Icons.Token />, **you may be removed from Majeggstics**.

</div>

<Anchored h2="Completion" />

After all the boosting has taken place, it's only a matter of waiting, frequently
checking in, and sending chicken runs to your co-op mates until the co-op has finished.
Check in ASAP after the contract has finished so that your contract score can be
calculated.


<Anchored
  anchor="freestyle"
  h2="(Re-)running your own contracts within Majeggstics"
/>

Many players in Majeggstics will always be happy to help you out if you are looking to run a contract in your own grade to advance into a higher contract grade or if you missed out on the normal Maj runs and want to still get rewards.

<div class="infobox">
**Promotion Runs:** If you are looking to promote into a higher contract grade, check the resources in <mark>[\#mj-freestyle][mj-freestyle]</mark> to find an <mark>ULTRA <Icons.Ultra /></mark> player in your respective grade to create an <Icons.Anygrade /> Anygrade version of the contract you want to run (If you have a subscription yourself, you can skip this step). That way players from all grades can join and help you out!

**Reruns due to missed contract:** If you missed out on the normal Majeggstics runs and you want to get the contract rewards still, you can ask for a rerun in the <mark>[\#mj-freestyle][mj-freestyle]</mark> channel for people to help you with it. Please keep in mind that you should always try to run with the normal Majeggstics coops, since rerunning contracts causes extra work for quite a few people.

Generally, please be patient if you do not get a reply right away. People might be busy or still in normal Maj co-ops.
</div>

<div class="alertbox">
We only allow co-ops for a contract to be posted in <mark>[\#mj-freestyle][mj-freestyle]</mark> once all Majeggstics timeslots have passed. Posting before that may result in the message being deleted and a warning given.
</div>

<Anchored anchor="taking_breaks" h2="Taking Breaks & Leaving" />

We're here to help you be successful with contracts, but we understand that you need a break sometimes.

<div class="infobox">
**Not registering**:
You are never required to register for contracts with us. Skip signing up whenever you
like with no penalties.

**Leaving the group**:
If you want to leave the Majeggstics for any reason, ping one of the leaders of
Majeggstics and ask to be removed from the group or remove yourself with the command
`/farewell user:[your name]`.

**Staying to socialize**:
If you quit playing but enjoy the community, you are welcome to stay in the group. You
don't have to play Egg, Inc., and we enjoy having friends!

7. Keep chat about Majeggstics and Wonky in our channels&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;in public channels this often becomes recruitment or bragging, and reflects poorly on our group.
8. There are many private co-op groups in the server, with different playstyles and requirements for joining. Be respectful of the other groups and how they play the game, even if it's different from us.
9. You will be removed from Majeggstics for glitching/cheating in our co-ops.
   - Server staff are notified of cheating players and may apply server-wide penalties.
10. Use bot command channels instead of discussion channels to send commands:
    - <mark>[Utilities > \#bot-commands](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/455512567004004353)</mark>
    - <mark>[Wonky > \#public-wonky-commands](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/850486132713455616)</mark>
    - <mark>[Majeggstics > \#wonky-spam](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/1082528529754898482)</mark>
11. Don't try to break bots, and be patient when bots are down.
12. Keep spam in <mark>[Off Topic > \#spam](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/455388192674283521)</mark>.
13. Direct Messages (DM)
    - Majeggstics is privileged to have threads for all of our
      co-ops&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;ping members in your thread instead of sending a DM
      or sending tokens <Icons.Token /> in-game.
    - Use Majeggstics and server channels to ask general questions instead of sending
      DMs to other players, Tokens <Icons.Token />, or server staff.
    - If you see inappropriate chat in Majeggstics channels, or glitching in our co-ops,
      you can react with the `:flag_white:` emoji to notify Majeggstics Tokens
      <Icons.Token />. Wonky will automatically remove your reaction to protect your
      privacy, and Tokens <Icons.Token /> will get a copy of the message.
    - Follow instructions in <mark>[Utilities >
      \#ticket-tool](https://discord.com/channels/455380663013736479/968650654694379560)</mark> for help from server staff (unwanted/inappropriate DMs, glitching in non-Majeggstic co-ops, etc).
    - If you get removed from the group, you will receive a DM from a Token <Icons.Token /> of Majeggstics. This will usually state the reason why you got removed as well as any further process that may offer re-entry into the group.
