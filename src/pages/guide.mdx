# Majeggstics Guide & Rule Book!

Welcome to The Majeggstics, where _No Farmer is Left Behind_!

Majeggstics is a worldwide group of Egg Inc. players with the common goal of making sure _every_ player can complete _every_ contract, by optimizing play strategies and making fair contributions to our co-ops.

## Contract rules

The Majeggstics are a team — we expect everyone to contribute to our co-ops. When you register for a contract, you are agreeing to meet the minimum contribution for that contract.

**The minimum egg laying rate for each contract is posted in \#mj-announcements. Minimums are measured at 12 and 24 hours after contract start.**

We are handing out strikes to members, that do not comply with the rules set for our group. These strikeable offenses are the following:

- **Failed to reach minimums after 24 hours**: 
  - The 12 hour minimum is lower than the 24 hour minimum. If you meet the 12 hour minimum, you have passed! If you don't meet the 12 hour minimum, you still have not failed, but you must meet the 24 hour minimum to pass. If you fail to do so, you will receive a strike.

- **Failed to join the co-op on time**:
  - You will receive a strike for joining your co-op later than 5 hours after start, and an additional strike if you have not joined by the 24 hour check. 

- **More than 30 hours of consecutive offline time**:
  - You will receive a strike if you are not logging into the game for over 30 hours.

Tokens are the human players who manage the Majeggstics - we recruit new members, help people play the game more efficiently, start and add people to co-op groups, and confirm everyone has met the minimum required laying rate for each contract. You can see someone is a token by the little token icon next to their name.

A token will communicate with you if you receive a strike. Strikes are recorded. After four strikes, you will be removed from Majeggstics. Strikes are only counted for the last 20 contracts, whether you played them or not - after that, strikes are erased.

After a strike, a token will create a **private thread** in \#the_majeggstics to talk to you about what happened, and make sure you are supported to be successful in the future. If you're concerned you won't be successful, you can send `mj-support` anywhere in Majeggstics channels and a support token will help you out. It can take time to respond, so ask for help using `mj-support` early on!

Remember that the Majeggstic's goal is to see everyone succeed. Minimums are meant to help you, not hurt. If you're struggling to meet minimum or need help with a contract, ask for advice in \#the_majeggstics or your grade's Majeggstics channel. The group would be thrilled to help, and everyone will have the chance to learn along with you!

![New Contract Icon](/images/newContractIcon.jpg)

- Monday has a new contract for everyone. The first Monday of each month has a new Prophecy Egg (PE) contract. *(This will change as of the start of the Winter Season in 2024. From then on there will be only ONE new PE per season, rather than per month)*.

- Wednesday and Friday have leggacy contracts. Wednesday has a non-PE contract, and Friday has a PE contract. (If you have an ULTRA Standard or ULTRA Pro subscription, you will get an additional leggacy PE contract on Fridays).

- If you want to be pinged when contracts are released, go to #optional-roles and select the “Contracts” role.

When a new contract is released, a registration post will be posted in \#mj-announcements. Select a time slot — we start contracts at +1, +6, and +12 hours after the contract release. Register for the time slot that's most convenient for your schedule. You must join your co-op and start your farm within 5 hours of your start time. It is your responsibility to register early and join your co-op.

Registration for each time slot is finalized when Wonky creates co-ops. We recommend you sign up at least 15 minutes early, as co-ops may be created up to 5 minutes early because of the size of our group. If co-ops are late, be patient with initiators.

Late registrations may be accepted depending on initiator availability and available spaces in our co-ops. If you are unable to register for a contract with Majeggstics, you can ask for a rerun in \#mj-freestyle once the co-ops for Majeggstics have finished, join a public co-op in the "Co-Op Recruitment" section or organise your own contract with others!

## Joining your co-op

Wonky generated your co-op and started a thread in \#mj-contracts. Check your DMs from Wonky for the contract code.

- All our co-ops are precreated as Anygrade AAA co-ops. This is done by members of the group who have an active ULTRA subscription and volunteer to do this to ensure everyone can start immediately once the groups have been formed.

- Our co-ops are set to **private** to ensure that everyone participating meets our expectations. Do not share your co-op code or set the co-op to public — this can result in Majeggstics members getting kicked from our co-ops and makes extra work for tokens.

- If there is an error with your registration (e.g. registered in multiple co-ops, unable to join co-op due to grade) make use of the `!mj-coop` command in your co-op thread. Tokens will be with you shortly to resolve the issue.

  - There is currently a known bug when joining co-ops - you appear joined on your device, but not on the Egg Inc servers. Please confirm your game is in sync with the server by checking the eicoop link in your co-op thread _before boosting_.

- Wonky groups members together to ensure we have balanced teams. You must join the co-op you are assigned to. If you:

  - Join your co-op later than 5 hours after start, you will receive one strike.
  - Do not join your co-op before the 24-hour check, you will receive two strikes.
  - Join a Majeggstics co-op without being assigned by Wonky or a token or share the co-op code outside of Majeggstics, you might be removed from Majeggstics.

- Tokens monitor many co-op threads and can't respond to every message. If you need help, make sure to ask in #mj-contracts or use the `!mj-coop` command for problems with the co-op itself or the `mj-support` command for gameplay and minimum related issues. Don't be afraid to interrupt off-topic chat — our priority is helping your co-op complete successfully.

## Start and grow your contract farm

- Finish common research, buy habs, and buy transport.

  - Use artifacts that increase income like Demeter's Necklace, Tungsten Ankh, Vial of Martian Dust, Book of Basan; and artifacts that hold Shell Stones, Terra Stones, Soul Stones and Prophecy Stones.
  - Puzzle cubes will lower research costs - use your income-boosting artifacts, then switch your puzzle cube on while you're buying. If you need to save more, swap the cube out for a better income artifact.

- Equip your best **Ship in a Bottle (SIAB)** to help your co-op mates earn more money. Your SIAB is worth more to the team than any artifact you can equip for yourself. Tachyon deflectors are not useful until after teammates have boosted, so equip an extra artifact for yourself until then.

- **Soul Mirror** a higher EB player if you can't finish your common research or buy large enough habs/transport for your intended boosts.
  - The person in your contract with the highest EB will have a soul mirror icon next to their name in your Discord thread.
  - Majeggstics is privileged to have many high EB players with good availability who can help you maximize your earnings, but they are not required to do anything beyond following regular Majeggstics rules for playing the contract.
  - Use Bird Feeds to maximize your earnings, no matter your mirror's EB.
  - While using a Soul Mirror, EB increasing artifacts on yourself have no effect. Book of Basan, Soul Stones and Prophecy Stones will not increase the earnings in this case, rather swap for Shell or Terra Stones and a different earning artifact like a Vial of Martian Dust.
  
- Send **Chicken Runs** every 3 hours to help your co-op mates grow their farms.
- Request or send **tokens** to other co-op members upon request.
  - Sending tokens to another player can lower their contract teamwork score — be thoughtful when sending tokens, and do not spam send individual tokens. Consider if your teammate has already boosted and how many tokens an AFK player will return to before you send tokens.
  - Spamming individual tokens or token dumping is not allowed.

## Boosting

- Use [Gompaniyon ↗][gompaniyon] and [Majeggstics Contract Boost Calculator ↗][contractboostcalc] to help determine the best boost combination for your goals. These will vary widely depending on the contract, number of players in your group, your EB, and artifacts.
  - Most players can use a *Legendary Tachyon Prism* & *Epic Boost Beacon* to completely fill habs.
  - Players with Tier 4 Artifacts can often use *two Epic Tachyon Prisms* (together or separately) to fill habs over 50%.
  - Advanced artifact players with powerful dilithium and life sets can often hablock with a single *Epic Tachyon* and a few chicken runs post-boost. A powerful tachyon artifact set can result in shipping locking.
  - Consider the number of people in your contract and the impact deflectors will have on your laying rate — choose more GE efficient boosts in larger co-ops.
- Before boosting, equip artifacts with *Dilithium Stones* to increase your boost time.
- Immediately after starting your boosts, switch to your best *Dilithium Monocle*, *Chalice*, and artifacts with *Life Stones*. Leave the farm to take advantage of the *Internal Hatchery Calm* Epic Research. If needed, equip a *Gusset* to increase hab space.

## Post-boosting

- *Tachyon Deflectors* boost your co-op mates' laying rates — since Majeggstics aim for equal contributions, a deflector will benefit your co-op overall more than any artifact that only works on your individual farm. 
- *Quantum Metronome* and artifacts with *Tachyon Stones* boost egg laying rate.
- *Interstellar Compass* and artifacts with *Quantum Stones* increase shipping rate.
- *Check in regularly* and don't let your chickens fall asleep!
  - The game does not update automatically. You must open your co-op farm and sync with the server for us to see your earnings before minimums are checked. Please check-in 15 minutes before your minimum check and confirm your lay rate using the eicoop link in your thread to avoid getting a strike. If you experience issues with syncing the game, please contact `mj-support` for help.
- *Contact a token:*
  - If you see glitching in your group. Glitching is not allowed in Majeggstics co-ops.
  - Enforcing minimum is the responsibility of tokens. Do not ping low performing members yourself, allow tokens to contact them and offer support.
  - Removing members from our contracts is not allowed. If you remove Majeggstics players from our co-op without specific instructions from a token, you will be removed from Majeggstics.

## Completion

- Check in ASAP after the contract has finished so that your contract score can be calculated.

## Taking Breaks & Leaving

We're here to help you be successful with contracts, but we understand that sometimes you need a break.

- **Not registering**: 
  - You can skip registering for contracts with us whenever you like with no penalties.
  
- **Leaving the group**: 
  - if you're not enjoying being a Majeggstic, want to join another Wonky group, or are retiring from the game, ping one of the leaders of Majeggstics and ask to be removed from group or remove yourself with the command `/farewell user:[your name]`.
  
- **Staying to socialize**: 
  - If you quit playing but enjoy the community, you can stay in the group. You don't have to play Egg Inc, and we enjoy having friends!

## Code of Conduct

It is a privilege for Majeggstics to have access to private channels and Wonky in the
Egg, Inc. server. Because of our special status, we have high expectations for your
behavior in our channels and around the server. 

If you do not follow the group rules or show unacceptable behavior in the Majeggstics channels, you may receive a warning from our tokens. These warnings are to be taken seriously, if you continue with the behavior you will eventually get removed from Majeggstics without a chance to rejoin.

- [Follow server \#rules ↗](rules). Majeggstics members and channels must follow the Egg, Inc. server rules. Violating server rules will lead to removal from Majeggstics and the Egg, Inc. server.
- Keep chat in Majeggstics kind and appropriate for all, and be a good representative of Majeggstics in public channels. However do not advertise the group in public channels.
- Respect Majeggstics tokens when asked to change your behavior.
- Current events and politics can only be discussed in Off-Topic \#current-events.
- Majeggstics is a friendly and caring group of people, but we are limited in the support we can provide. If you need to chat about mental health, check out:
  - [7 Cups of Tea ↗][7cups]: Free 24/7 chat by trained volunteers.
  - [Dialectical Behaviour Therapy ↗][dialectical]: Free, anonymous, independent skills and tools to help manage big feelings.
  - [Project Lets ↗][projectlets]: Community-support based mental health care, by and for folks with lived experience of mental illness/madness, Disability, trauma and neurodivergence.
- Majeggstics has a system for recruiting that respects server rules and makes sure new members are a good fit for our group and play style.
  - Respect server rules about recruitment and co-op chat.
  - Check the pins in Co-op Recruitment > \#?-grade-coops to make sure we are currently recruiting, and have friends follow the instructions in our pinned post.
  - People struggling with public co-ops may not be a good fit for Majeggstics. Let them know about Co-Op Recruitment channels and the pinned posts, and allow them to choose the group that's right for them.
- Keep chat about Majeggstics and Wonky in our channels — in public channels this often becomes recruitment or bragging, and reflects poorly on our group.
- There are many private co-op groups in the server, with different play styles and requirements for joining. Be respectful of the other groups and how they play the game, even if it's different from us.
- You will be removed from Majeggstics for glitching/cheating in our co-ops.
  - Server staff are notified of cheating players and may apply server-wide penalties.
- Use bot commands channels instead of discussion channels to send commands:
  - Utilities > \#bot-commands
  - Wonky > \#public-wonky-commands
  - Majeggstics > \# wonky-spam
- Don't try to break bots, and be patient when bots are down.
- Keep spam in Off Topic > \#spam.
- Direct Messages (DM)
  - Majeggstics is privileged to have threads for all of our co-ops — ping members in your thread instead of sending a DM or sending tokens in-game.
  - Use Majeggstics and server channels to ask general questions instead of sending DMs to other players, tokens, or server staff.
  - If you see inappropriate chat in Majeggstics channels, or glitching in our co-ops, you can react with the :flag_white: emoji to notify Majeggstics Tokens. Wonky will automatically remove your reaction to protect your privacy, and Tokens will get a copy of the message.
  - Follow instructions in Utilities > \#ticket-tool for help from server staff
    (unwanted/inappropriate DMs, glitching in non-Majeggstic co-ops, etc.)
  - If you get removed from the group, you will receive a DM from a token of Majeggstics. This will usually state the reason why you got removed as well as any further process that may offer re-entry into the group.
